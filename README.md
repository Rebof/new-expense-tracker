The Expense Tracker is a cross-platform desktop application intended to help users easily 
manage personal finances. Users are also able to track inflows and outflows in cash, 
besides debts, without many hustles. This application supports custom tags, 
comprehensive financial summary dashboards, and transaction searching, filtering, and 
sorting by type, date, and tag. It was designed to be friendly for the user and ensured that 
debts were managed efficiently and that pending payments came into view. The data will 
be kept safe but shared in JSON format for easy and structured handling. This application 
is meant to make financial management a lesser hassle by providing users an intuitive 
and efficient way of tracking.
